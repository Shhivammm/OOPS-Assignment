        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- OOP is a way of writing programs where we think in terms of real-world things, like objects. These objects can store data and do stuff with that data (using methods). It's super helpful for organizing your code and making it more reusable. The main ideas in OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class is like a plan or a design for creating objects. It tells Python what data the object will have and what actions it can do. Think of it like a recipe, and objects are the dishes you make from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is something you create from a class. It's a real, working thing based on the class plan. For example, if you have a class called Car, you can make objects like car1, car2, etc. Each object has its own data and can do stuff.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction is about showing only the important stuff and hiding the rest. Like when you drive a car, you don’t need to know how the engine works.\n",
        "- Encapsulation is about keeping data and methods together in one place and keeping the internal details private.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods are special methods with double underscores (like __init__, __str__, etc.). They help Python understand how your object should behave in different situations, like printing it or adding two objects together.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- Inheritance lets one class (a child) take all the stuff from another class (a parent). It's great because you don’t have to repeat code—you just reuse what’s already there and add or change what you need.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism means one function can work in different ways depending on the object that uses it. Like different animals might have a 'speak()' method, but each one speaks differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- We use underscores to make variables private (like __balance). Then we use methods (getters and setters) to control how these variables are accessed or changed from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "The constructor is a method called __init__ that runs automatically when you make a new object. It's used to set up the object with some initial data.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Class methods use @classmethod and take 'cls' as the first parameter. They can change stuff at the class level.\n",
        "- Static methods use @staticmethod and don’t need 'self' or 'cls'. They’re just regular functions inside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Python doesn’t officially support method overloading like other languages. But you can fake it using default arguments or *args and **args to handle different numbers of inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- If a child class has a method with the same name as one in its parent, it overrides the parent’s version. When you call it, the child’s version runs instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The @property decorator lets you call a method like it's a regular variable. It’s helpful when you want to control access to a value but still make it easy to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism makes your code more flexible. You can write one piece of code that works on different types of objects without knowing their exact type. It’s clean and saves time.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class is like a base class that you can’t create an object from. It just provides a structure for other classes to build on. You use it when you know some methods must be defined in future classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Keeps code organized\n",
        "- Makes code easier to update and reuse\n",
        "- Avoids repeating yourself (DRY principle)\n",
        "- Matches how we think about real-world problems\n",
        "- Works great when you're building big projects with a team\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class variables are shared by all objects of the class.\n",
        "- Instance variables are different for each object—you can change one without affecting the others.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- It means a class can inherit from more than one parent. For example:\n",
        "class A: pass\n",
        "class B: pass\n",
        "class C(A, B): pass\n",
        "Just be careful because it can get messy if both parents have the same method names.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "- __str__ is for nice, readable output when you print an object.\n",
        "- __repr__ is for developers. It shows more detailed info that helps you understand what the object is or recreate it.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "- super() lets you call methods from the parent class. It's super useful when you want to keep the parent’s behavior but also add your own stuff.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- __del__ is called when an object is deleted. You don’t often need it, but you can use it to clean up things like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- @staticmethod doesn’t care about the class or object—it’s just a normal function inside a class.\n",
        "- @classmethod takes the class itself as the first argument and can change class-level stuff.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Let’s say a parent class has a method and two child classes override it. You can loop through the child objects and call the same method name, and they’ll each do their own version. That’s polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- This means calling multiple methods one after another like:\n",
        "obj.set_name(\"Tom\").set_age(25).greet()\n",
        "To do this, each method needs to return self.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- If a class has __call__, you can use its object like a function. So, writing obj() will actually call obj.__call__(). It’s a neat trick for making objects behave like functions.\n",
